Here I will be posting links to different pages, and explain about them briefly. Please follow this [Official GRE website](https://www.ets.org/gre) to know about GRE. GRE is the standard test accepted by many top Universities across the globe mainly for Graduate Studies. GRE scores are just a cut-off, Universities consider several other factors such as **SOP, LORs, Grades, Publications and Other achievements.** <br/>
GRE has the total of 6 sections in Main Exam. First Section is of Analytical Writing Section, then two Quant Sections and two Verbal Sections and one Research section. I will be going through all the sections. <br/>
The most helpful thing in my preparation was regular Mock Test that I took. It helps me to analyze my weak points and strong areas as well so that I focussed more on my weak areas. Below are my test scores that I got throughout my progress (only giving here so that you do not loose hopes before giving your main exam) <br/>
- **Power Prep I** - 136V, 168Q (very weak in verbal section)
- **Power Prep II** -148V, 169Q (slight improvement than Power Prep I)
- **GRE Exam** - 153V,169Q (Better than previous Power Prep Tests)
- **GRE Exam attempt 2** 158V, 168Q (Better as compared to my previous scores) <br/>
**There is always scope to improve your scores, need to follow the right Procedure.**
