Analytical Writing Section is divided into 2 parts, Analyze the Issue and Analyze the Argument. Both the sections are given 30 minutes each. Marking is done out of 6 with the difference of 0.5.
## General Strategy

### Analyze the Issue
- Explore the complexities.
- Form an opinion.
- Defend your Position. <br/>
You can choose to support or oppose the issue, but make sure you have enough points to support your position.
- Brainstorm Points for **both** the sides. The side you choose to support and the side you oppose.
- Choose the position that is **easiest** for you to defend.
- Identify one or two **opposing points and find rebuttals**.
- Write the essay in a predetermined format.
- Proof Read (not necessary). I will recommend adding a paragraph in that time.
#### Basic Format
- Tell the reader **What you are going to say** i.e., your introduction.
- Tell the readers **What you want to say** i.e., the body of the essay.
- Remind the readers **What you just told them** i.e., conclusion.
#### Opposite Side
- State opposing side.
- State Rebuttals.
- Elaborate your point by adding the example. An example can be real or formed.
#### Conclusion
- Briefly restate points that you used to support your position on the issue.
- Then at the end restate your position.
### Argument Analysis
- Write Critical Analysis.
- Is Conclusion appropriate given the premises?
- The conclusion is **never** appropriate.
- Explain why.
#### General Strategy
- Summarize premises and conclusion.
- List flaws choose 2 to 4 flaws.
- For each flaw:
- Identify Underlying Assumptions.
- Explain why assumption is faulty.
- Provide alternative explanation.
- Identify information needed to evaluate the argument.
- Write essay with emphasis on instructions.
#### Most common faults
- Cause and effect faults. Often correlation is compared with the causation. 
- Statistical Flaws, sample is not representative of entire population.
- Conclusion does not match statistics.
