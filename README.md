I want to share my experience with GRE test, the resources that I used such as Practice tests, the books, Vocabulary lists and the startegies that I applied to tackle different types of questions in Quant as well as Verbal Section. I started off my GRE preparation with very low score in Verbal Section, it was 136 when I gave my first Power Prep Test on official ETS.org website. I was suggested by my seniors to write an exam before starting of my preparations, I scored 168-169 in Quant section and 136 on Verbal section and then with strategic preparation I ended up getting 158 in Verbal section in GRE Exam. I have experienced that many of us start off with very low scores and it can be very depressing at first. <br/>
